# Volatility-and-the-Equity-Risk-Premium

Code written for the empirical part of my master thesis "Volatility and the Equity Risk Premium". 
The code constructs a volatility linked real time index of the equity risk premium and its term structure according to "What is 
the Expected Return on the Market?" (Martin, 2017). Further, probabilities of a 20% market decline implied by option prices are calculated.
